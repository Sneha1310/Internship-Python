## 🎯 Objective

To analyze Titanic passenger data and build a predictive model that estimates survival chances.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📊 Features Used

- `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Fare`, `Embarked`
- Feature engineering: handling missing values, encoding, scaling

## 🔍 ML Models Applied

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## ✅ Result

- Accuracy: ~**XX%** (update based on your result)
- Best Model: Random Forest (or whichever)

## 📌 Conclusion

Built and evaluated ML models for binary classification (survived/not). Demonstrated preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
