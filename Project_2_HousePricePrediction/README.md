# 🏠 House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project focuses on predicting house prices using a linear regression model based on the **Ames Housing dataset**. The goal is to build a simple yet effective predictive model and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data.

## 📌 Project Objective

> Develop a linear regression model to predict house price based on features such as the number of rooms, location, size, and other relevant factors.  
> The dataset was collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).

## 🗂️ Project Structure

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Step 1** | Import necessary libraries |
| **Step 2** | Load the dataset and preview it |
| **Step 3** | Perform basic exploration and calculate the average house price |
| **Step 4** | Create a correlation heatmap to identify important relationships |
| **Step 5** | Generate a bar chart for categorical features (e.g., Overall Quality) |
| **Step 6** | Select relevant features for modeling |
| **Step 7** | Train the linear regression model |
| **Step 8** | Evaluate model performance using R² Score |
| **Step 9** | Visualize actual vs predicted sale prices and conclude the analysis |

## 📊 Key Visualizations

- 📌 **Correlation Heatmap** – to identify feature relationships  
- 📌 **Bar Chart** – showing count of houses by quality  
- 📌 **Scatter Plot** – comparing actual vs predicted sale prices  

---

## ✅ Results & Conclusion

- The model shows a reasonable prediction capability based on selected features.
- Features such as `GrLivArea` and `OverallQual` had the highest correlation with house prices.
- The average sale price in the dataset was approximately **$XXXXXX**.
- The scatter plot shows the model captures general trends but may benefit from more complex features in future models.

> ✨ This project demonstrates a beginner-friendly approach to data science projects using linear regression and EDA.
